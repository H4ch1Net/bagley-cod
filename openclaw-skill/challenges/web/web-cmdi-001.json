  "description": "A web application has a 'ping' utility that takes an IP address as input:\n\n```php\n$ip = $_GET['ip'];\nsystem(\"ping -c 4 \" . $ip);\n```\n\nThe input is concatenated directly into a shell command without sanitization.\n\nCraft a payload that will also run `cat /etc/passwd` after the ping command.\n\nSubmit the separator character you'd use: flag{separator}\n\nHint: You need a shell metacharacter that says 'run this next command regardless'",
