You attempt to query it using common community strings:\n\n$ snmpwalk -v2c -c public 192.168.1.1\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: Cisco IOS Software, 2800 Series\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: core-router-01\n...\n\nThe community string 'public' gave you read access. This is a serious misconfiguration.\n\nWhat is the default SNMP community string for WRITE access (which would let you modify the device configuration)?\n\nSubmit as: flag{community_string}",
