Running `strings image.png | tail -5` reveals:\n\n...\nIDATx\nIEND\nflag{strings_reveals_secrets}\nPK\n\nThe flag was appended after the PNG IEND marker. What command-line tool did you use to find it?\n\nSubmit the flag you found.",

    "The 'strings' command extracts printable character sequences from binary files",
